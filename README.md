## Overview

**preloved** is a conceptual customer-to-customer trading platform in which users may log in and out, browse listings, and create/edit/delete their own listings. It was created for an academic project. The data used by the web app is managed through MongoDB.

## Installation

1. Install node modules in both front-end and back-end folders
2. Configure config.json files with your specific local host address
3. Bring up the terminal. cd into the backend folder, run **nodemon**. If successful, you should recieve a prompt that informs you that the database is connected.
4. If you need to make changes to the SCSS files, cd into the frontend folder and run **gulp watch**.
5. Open index.html in a live server, or open the page through your localhost address.

### Notes

There are currently features of this web app that are not fully functional (yet). These include:

* Starred listings
* Cart
* Minor visual bugs on smaller device screens
